- A camera as view point
- setup a virtual viewport through which to pass our scene rays
- normal vector is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane, same as in physics



our eyes are naturally doing what we want our ray tracer to do: 
integrate the (continuous function of) light falling on a particular (discrete) region of our rendered image.



Anti-aliasing:
- at every pixel, average the color of neighbors
- generates a random sample point within the unit square centered at the origin
- then transform the random sample from this ideal square back to the particular pixel we're currently sampling
